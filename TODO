make node include entities and call onStart on them. 
  - One of them should be what triggers windows and/or kicks off a song.
call it a wrap for v1.0, baby
-----
features to add for v2.0:
  scripting automation:
    \- config file tree generation
    - provide find, create, edit, delete, and list functions with tab-completion for the following,
      including templates and auto-registry when necessary:
        - custom types
        - port set keys and types
        - conditions
        - node
          - entity
            - body
            - personality
              - tree
                - functions
            - bb
        - dialogue
        - menu
        - grid
    - making Makefile (and later, CMakeLists) automate port set generation from function definitions. Should bomb on clash.

testing:
  remake Battle to test and refine engine
  go to Battle node on contact with enemy; return when done with enemy disappearing
  go from one room to the other


WONDERING:
----------
i wonder if some parts of bicycle-rpg are fit for integration into bicycle? The registry function seems pretty useful. main() standard too. scripts and template folders.
