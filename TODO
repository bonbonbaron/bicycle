I want to make config-reading easier  by having a list of things that each class expects:

Battle:
  shared pointer to destintion Battle member  |  optional  |   dialogue   
  shared pointer to destination required  |  combatants.enemyList
  required  partyList
  and every other thing you can expect to read from a battle.

I think it'll come clearer to me how to properly do this as I go about it. Like with everythign else.
