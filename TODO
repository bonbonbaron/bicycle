\graft trees onto each other
\propagate blackboard shared pointers throughout tree
input and output port specifications (why the distinction though?)

any way to get bb.get() to return a reference?
test personality
make ONLY three triggers for trees: onTimer, onInput, onCall
make onTimer() easy
make onInput() easy
