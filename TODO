I'm finally opening my eyes I'd kept closed out of pride against the knowledge of the world; fostering the belief that I'm better, I'm smarter than them, I'm more gifted.
To face the truth means to be open to humbling. To admit others are better, smarter, know more, faster, and beyond my grasp.
The wisdom in God lifting up those who humble themselves is profound.

So with that pontificating out of my system, let's talk about what i've learned so far:

Archetypes: They have SoA with no holes, allowing for rapid processing. The reason it's SoA rather than AoS is because of parallelization opportunities and SIMD.
            When an entity gains a new component, it migrates to another archetype; one that may or may not exist.
            Allows trivial adding/removing of components; that wouldn't be the case with AoS.
            
goal: 
  1. make action headers
  2. auto-register actions
  3. detect ports and their types used in actions
  4. check for port type conflicts; bomb if so
  5. if no conflicts exist, auto-register the port

  1. auto-register BBs

  1. CRUD ops for:
    * entites
      * bodies
      * BBs
      * personaltiies
        * trees
          * actions
    * menus
    * dialogues
    * grids
      * BGs

OR...

I could simply start making games and worry about the above later.

version 2.0:
------------
features to add for v2.0:
  scripting automation:
    \- config file tree generation
    - provide find, create, edit, delete, and list functions with tab-completion for the following,
      including templates and auto-registry when necessary:
        - custom types
        - port set keys and types
        - conditions
        - node
          - entity
            - body
            - personality
              - tree
                - functions
            - bb
        - dialogue
        - menu
        - grid
    - making Makefile (and later, CMakeLists) automate port set generation from function definitions. Should bomb on clash.

testing:
  remake Battle to test and refine engine
  go to Battle node on contact with enemy; return when done with enemy disappearing
  go from one room to the other
