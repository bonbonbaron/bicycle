"Event" keeps confusing me. What I really mean is Action; DOING something, not just "Something happened."
Some actions happen uncondtionally; others must be triggered:
 * by logic
 * by timer
 * by input
 * (later) by network activity
And it makes sense that sometimes we're not listening to the player's input; something else is transpiring
 outside the player's control.
Is it necessarily a behavior tree then? Not  necessarily, but it migth help. 
Certain elements are repeatable:
 listen for menu selection input: move the cursor around, select the current item, or cancel.
 SIDE NOTE: the above statement hints at the separation between action and presentation.
 =========  For a menu, back-side, I may point at a lambda, but front-side point at its representation.
            That splits the behavior and representation of a menu item or any other widget.
            So let's tweak the front-side in YAML and the back in C++.

            The front side has the following properties:
             location
             string symbol
             color
            
            The back side *universally* has these:
             behavior tree
               behavior node
                 action
                 (optional) trigger

It may be true that if something doesn't have a front side, it has no back side either. Ghosts aren't real.


Therefore the idea that a node has its own behavior was ill-conceived. Every entity has its own behavior.
Okay, so we're back to entities again. A menu is an entity.
This means from a player perspective, entities can have focus.

Seems now as though a lot of design wisdom can be pulled from jollybean.

Action is a lambda that returns ActionState.
Behavior Tree is a tree of Action nodes whose flow is controlled by its states.
Trigger is an input, timer, or logic.
Priority determines whether a tree interrupts an active tree.
Quirk is a trio of behavior tree, priority, and trigger.
Personality is a set of quirks.
Body is the flip-side of Personality; the imaginary membrane between them separates controller from view.

Only things that concern me about the above:
============================================
 1) Can multiple entities listen to input at once? That might not be good but also gives flexibility.
 2) Having a bunch of willy nilly actions reintroduces the problem of blackboards lacking requisites for action.
