goal: 
  1. make action headers
  2. auto-register actions
  3. detect ports and their types used in actions
  4. check for port type conflicts; bomb if so
  5. if no conflicts exist, auto-register the port

  1. auto-register BBs

  1. CRUD ops for:
    * entites
      * bodies
      * BBs
      * personaltiies
        * trees
          * actions
    * menus
    * dialogues
    * grids
      * BGs

OR...

I could simply start making games and worry about the above later.

version 2.0:

features to add for v2.0:
  scripting automation:
    \- config file tree generation
    - provide find, create, edit, delete, and list functions with tab-completion for the following,
      including templates and auto-registry when necessary:
        - custom types
        - port set keys and types
        - conditions
        - node
          - entity
            - body
            - personality
              - tree
                - functions
            - bb
        - dialogue
        - menu
        - grid
    - making Makefile (and later, CMakeLists) automate port set generation from function definitions. Should bomb on clash.

testing:
  remake Battle to test and refine engine
  go to Battle node on contact with enemy; return when done with enemy disappearing
  go from one room to the other
